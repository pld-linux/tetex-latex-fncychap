FNCYCHAP Readme-file (Release 4 v1.11) 1997/04/06

To install this put the sty file in a directory searched by TeX. 
The LaTeX-base has to be post 1994/12/01.
However, a warning will be given if the base is
older than 1995/12/01.

Print the user documentation contained in the
file FncyChap.ps
I know this is not the best possible way to include user
documentation. However, I will consider other alternatives 
in the future.
